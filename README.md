<h2><strong>m4x-EventReminder</strong></h2>
<p>Have you ever forgot to pickup the quest to do 20 World Quests just to realize it <em>after you've already done 10 of them?</em></p>
<p>Well, this addon <em>is for you</em>.</p>
<p><em>m4x-EventReminder</em> will notify you of the weekly Bonus Events and let you pickup the quest for them right there on the spot, so you don't miss out on any Bonus Event quest you want.</p>
<p>Choose what events you want to be notified about, <em>with some information about each one on mouseover</em>.</p>

<p>Get a notification on screen with a direct way to get the quest and a preview of the reward.</p>

<p>Don't want to be bothered by the notification but want the quest? Just disable it and you will still get the quest, with or without confirmation (<em>auto-accept the quest</em>), <em>your choice</em>.</p>
